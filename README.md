# denote in Rust

## What's denote?

It's a cool project from Protesilaos Stavrou

More details here:

https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote

## Why a rewrite in Rust

Because I can!

Also Rust may be a better language to built tools on top of it than Lisp

For instance, it should be easy to provide Python or Javascript implementations
of denotes.

## Command line usage

See:

```bash
cargo run -- --help
```

## Kakoune integration

Work in progress
